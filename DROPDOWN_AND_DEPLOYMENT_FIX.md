# Services Dropdown & Deployment Fix Complete

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Services Dropdown Auto-Appearing ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Services dropdown was appearing on every page automatically

- Added click-outside detection to close dropdown
- Added specific CSS rules to disable problematic hover effects
- Added chevron arrow with rotation animation

**Solution Applied**:
