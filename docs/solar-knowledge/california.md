# California Solar Intelligence Dossier — Northern Region

## Snapshot
- **Territory focus:** Redding, Shasta County, North State corridor (I-5 spine out to Trinity & Tehama counties)
- **Primary utilities:** PG&E (investor-owned), Redding Electric Utility (REU municipal)
- **Service specialty:** Triage + revive orphaned solar systems whose original installer is defunct; layer in proactive maintenances & upgrade packages.

## Regulatory Landscape
- **NEM 3.0 realities (effective April 2023):** Export credits dropped ~75–80% vs NEM 2.0 (≈$0.05/kWh vs $0.30); time-of-use evening rates spike. Position battery retrofits, load shifting, and smart controls as must-haves.[^nem3]
- **Assembly Bill 942 (2024):** Eliminates legacy NEM grandfathering upon property sale; new buyers automatically shift to NEM 3.0. Emphasize due diligence services when homes change hands.[^ab942]
- **CPU’s Consumer Protection Guide:** Mandates contract disclosures, three-day rescission, and outlines escalation paths. Build trust content + compliance CTA.[^cpc]
- **Redding Electric Utility nuances:** REU aligns with CA Solar Consumer Protection but maintains its own interconnection portal; highlight concierge paperwork service.

## Permitting & Inspection Notes
- **Shasta County Building Division (Apr 2025 update):**
  - Permit packet requires PE stamp for structural modifications; Title 24 compliance checklists.
  - Residential inspections scheduled via (530) 244-5068; average 5–7 day lead.
  - Emergency repair waivers possible with post-facto inspection within 10 days.[^shasta]
- **City of Redding expedited solar permitting:** Online submittal for <15 kW; larger or storage-coupled systems require load calc uploads.

## Incentives & Financing
- **Federal 30% ITC:** Still available through 2032; sunset ramps begin 2033. Align marketing urgency for 2025 installs while credit is full.[^solarcom]
- **Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP):**
  - Feb 2025 Resolution E-5373 integrates IRA tax benefits into SGIP reimbursements.
  - Residential Solar & Storage Equity budget (AB 209) targets wildfire-prone + low-income ZIPs (many in Shasta/Butte). Position resilience packages accordingly.[^sgip]
- **Local rebates:** Redding Electric Utility intermittently offers battery rebates; monitor quarterly announcements.

## Interconnection & Utility Touchpoints
- **PG&E Solar Billing Plan:** Applications filed after Apr 14, 2023 default to NEM 3.0; storage additions require updated interconnection forms.[^pge]
- **Data needed upfront:** Single-line diagrams, equipment spec sheets, NEM discovery documents, proof of contractor C-46 license (or partnering engineering letter).
- **Service hook:** Offer white-glove paperwork + virtual utility inspection walk-through for orphaned systems.

## Consumer Pain Map (for Sandler “Red” stage)
- Stranded warranties + failing inverters after installer bankruptcy.
- Bill shock under NEM 3.0 due to poor load management.
- Lack of wildfire resiliency / backup during PSPS events.
- Confusion around SGIP paperwork + battery pairing.

## Technical Arsenal (Sandler “Yellow” stage feedstock)
- Rapid inverter swap protocols (SMA, SolarEdge, Enphase).
- Battery retrofits: LG Chem RESU, Tesla Powerwall, FranklinWH.
- Monitoring upgrades: Sense, Solar Analytics, custom Home Assistant dashboards.
- Preventative maintenance benchmarks: IR scanning, string-level IV curve tracing, critter guard refresh cadence.

## ROI / Green Storylines
- Model savings via load shifting (charge at midday, discharge 6–9 pm) to reclaim 25–40% of lost export value under NEM 3.0.
- Wildfire outage mitigation: quantify avoided generator fuel + hotel stays ($250/night avg during PSPS).
- Warranty rescue value: compare cost of new system vs repair (<40% of replacement on average for North State quotes).

## Logistics & Fulfillment Considerations
- **Shipping center:** Stage out of Redding hub; LTL freight reach to NorCal, Southern OR, Reno within 2–3 day windows.
- **Cost model:** Base $2.10/mile for palletized modules; battery hazmat surcharge $185 per shipment; add liftgate fee for rural deliveries.
- **Customer calculator inputs:** ZIP-based distance, equipment class (modules/inverters/batteries), expedited install surcharge (48h).

## Content & Messaging Hooks
- “Installer disappeared? We rescue stranded solar in 7 days.”
- “NEM 3.0 made your bill spike—here’s how load shifting + storage neutralizes it.”
- “Wildfire season ready kits: battery + rapid disconnect + monitoring.”
- “Home sale transfer checkup: inspection, compliance wrap, and new-owner onboarding.”
