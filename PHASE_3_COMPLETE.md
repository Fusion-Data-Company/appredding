## 💡 BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISONS

### Hero Section:
**Before**: Static background

### Metrics Cards:
**Before**: Static numbers, instant appearance  
**After**: **Icons float gently, numbers count up when scrolled into view**

### Content Sections:
**Before**: Fade in from same direction  
**After**: **Each section reveals from unique direction, maintaining visual interest**

### Overall Page Feel:
**Before**: Professional, polished  
**After**: **Legendary, cinematic, story-driven experience**

## 🚀 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

### 1. **Parallax Performance**
```typescript
// Uses Framer Motion's useScroll with RAF
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: ref,
  offset: ['start end', 'end start']
});
const y = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [-offset, offset]);
```
**Result:** Smooth 60fps parallax with no jank

### 2. **Counter Animation**
```typescript
// Spring physics for natural counting
const springValue = useSpring(motionValue, {
  duration: 2000,
  bounce: 0,
});
```
**Result:** Numbers count up naturally, not robotically

### 3. **Reveal Optimization**
```typescript
// IntersectionObserver, not scroll listeners
const isInView = useInView(ref, { 
  once: true, 
  margin: '-100px' 
});
```
**Result:** Efficient, no performance impact
