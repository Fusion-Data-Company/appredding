        question: "What makes Praetorian SmartCoat different from other protective coatings?",
        answer: "Praetorian SmartCoat is a cutting-edge ceramic insulating coating that combines a proprietary ceramic microsphere technology with durable acrylic polymers to create a high-performance protective membrane. The coating provides superior thermal insulation, waterproofing, and fire resistance for a wide range of building and infrastructure applications."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the ceramic technology actually work?",
        answer: "Our ceramic microsphere technology contains millions of hollow ceramic microspheres embedded within an acrylic polymer matrix. These microspheres trap air, a natural insulator, reducing heat transfer through roofs and walls. The coating also has reflective properties with light colors and ceramic particles that reflect solar radiation, minimizing heat absorption. According to testing, our coating has a Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) of 85-92%."
      },
      {
        question: "What kind of temperature reduction can I expect?",
        answer: "Thermal imaging studies have shown roofs treated with Praetorian Smart-Coat typically show up to 30°F (17°C) lower surface temperatures compared to untreated controls under peak summer conditions. This temperature reduction helps decrease cooling costs and improves comfort inside buildings. The actual energy efficiency improvements will vary depending on the specific application and environmental conditions."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do Praetorian SmartCoat products last?",
        answer: "Our coatings have a typical shelf life of 12 months when unopened and stored properly between 5°C and 30°C. Once applied, the service life depends on the application environment and maintenance. The durability of the coating is one of its strengths, resisting cracking, peeling, and degradation from environmental stresses such as UV exposure, thermal cycling, and chemical pollutants. This durability reduces maintenance frequency and costs over time."

    category: "Fire Protection",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What fire ratings do your coatings have?",
        answer: "Our coatings achieve a Class A fire rating per ASTM E108 / UL 790. When tested according to ASTM E84 standards for surface burning characteristics, the coating demonstrated excellent fire retardancy. The coating's fire resistance properties have been validated through extensive laboratory testing and real-world applications, making it suitable for fire protection applications."
      },
      {
        question: "How do your coatings perform in extreme heat?",
        answer: "Our coatings are designed to provide excellent thermal protection under extreme conditions. When tested according to ASTM E119 standards, 5-6 coats (approximately 30 mils thick) applied to 1/4 inch steel provide significant thermal protection for extended periods, helping to maintain structural integrity during fire events."
      },
      {
        question: "What thickness is required for effective fire protection?",
        answer: "For standard thermal insulation and energy efficiency, our coatings are typically applied at 17 mils wet / 10 mils dry thickness. For specific fire protection applications, we recommend 30 mils dry thickness (5-6 coats) to achieve maximum fire resistance properties, which is still significantly thinner than conventional fireproofing systems."
      },
      {
        question: "Are these coatings suitable for wildfire protection?",
        answer: "Yes, our coatings provide excellent protection in wildfire-prone areas. The Class A fire rating combined with the extreme temperature resistance makes them ideal for protecting structures in high-risk zones. The ceramic microsphere technology creates an effective thermal barrier that helps prevent ignition of the underlying structure during wildfire exposure."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What surfaces can Praetorian SmartCoat be applied to?",
        answer: "Our coatings can be applied to virtually any substrate including metal, wood, concrete, masonry, and various roofing materials. The water-based acrylic elastomeric resin provides exceptional adhesion while maintaining flexibility during thermal expansion/contraction cycles with 156% elongation capability (exceeding the standard 100% requirement)."
      },
      {
        question: "How are the coatings applied?",
        answer: "Application methods include airless sprayer (recommended for large areas), roller (suitable for most surfaces), or brush (for detail work). The coverage rate is approximately 80-100 sq ft per gallon depending on surface texture. Drying time is 1-2 hours to touch, 2-4 hours minimum before recoating, with full cure in 5-7 days."
      },
      {
        question: "What certifications do your products have?",
        answer: "Our products comply with ASTM E84 (fire testing), ASTM D6083 (waterproofing), ASTM E1269 (thermal properties), and ASTM E1461-92 (thermal diffusivity). They are verified by the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) with 89% reflection and 89% emittance, and hold Energy Star certification, Factory Mutual Class A fire rating, and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) certification for marine applications."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the ROI and payback period?",
        answer: "Typical payback periods range from 1-3 years depending on application. For example, the Sony Koda facility achieved remarkable energy consumption reduction of 87% in May (from 3,767 KW to 519 KW) with a payback period of just 1.06 years. Beyond energy savings, our coatings provide additional value through reduced maintenance costs, extended asset life, and multi-functional benefits."
