      {
        question: "What makes Praetorian SmartCoat different from other protective coatings?",
        answer: "Praetorian SmartCoat utilizes a triple-component system derived from NASA space shuttle thermal protection technology. Our coatings use vacuum-filled ceramic microspheres suspended in a specialized elastomeric matrix that addresses all three heat transfer mechanisms simultaneously (conduction, convection, and radiation) while providing Class A fire protection—a feat unmatched by traditional insulation materials."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the ceramic technology actually work?",
        answer: "Our ceramic microsphere technology creates multiple thermal breaks throughout the coating film. The fundamental principle exploits the physical impossibility of heat traversing vacuum spaces—heat cannot travel through vacuum. The ceramics themselves withstand temperatures up to 1300°C without heat transfer, effectively disrupting conductive pathways while our TiO₂ reflective technology achieves 89% solar reflection and 89% thermal emittance."
      },
      {
        question: "What kind of temperature reduction can I expect?",
        answer: "Our coatings typically reduce surface temperatures by 30-40°F compared to uncoated surfaces. In documented field tests, coated metal buildings maintained interior temperatures of 85°F while ambient temperatures reached 111-113°F, and uncoated buildings reached 180°F+ surface temperatures. Energy efficiency results range from 20-87% depending on the application type."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do Praetorian SmartCoat products last?",
        answer: "Our coatings demonstrate exceptional longevity with minimal performance degradation. With only 1% reflectivity loss over 3 years (compared to 10-20% for competing products), original applications from 1989 showed no deterioration or performance loss when inspected 30 years later in 2019. The typical service life is 20-30+ years with minimal maintenance."

    category: "Fire Protection",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What fire ratings do your coatings have?",
        answer: "Our coatings achieve a Class A fire rating (the highest possible classification) with perfect scores of 0/100 for both Flame Spread Index and Smoke Development Index in ASTM E84 testing. This has been verified by NASA, UL, and Factory Mutual, making our products suitable for the most demanding fire protection applications."
      },
      {
        question: "How do your coatings perform in extreme heat?",
        answer: "When tested at 2,732°F (1,500°C) for 20 minutes, our coatings maintained a back surface temperature of only 150°F while the front surface was at 2,296°F—an extraordinary 2,177°F temperature differential. Additionally, 5-6 coats (approximately 30 mils thick) applied to 1/4 inch steel passed tests against 1550°F (843°C) flame for 25+ minutes."
      },
      {
        question: "What thickness is required for effective fire protection?",
        answer: "For standard thermal insulation and energy efficiency, our coatings are typically applied at 17 mils wet / 10 mils dry thickness. For specific fire protection applications, we recommend 30 mils dry thickness (5-6 coats) to achieve maximum fire resistance properties, which is still significantly thinner than conventional fireproofing systems."
      },
      {
        question: "Are these coatings suitable for wildfire protection?",
        answer: "Yes, our coatings provide excellent protection in wildfire-prone areas. The Class A fire rating combined with the extreme temperature resistance makes them ideal for protecting structures in high-risk zones. The ceramic microsphere technology creates an effective thermal barrier that helps prevent ignition of the underlying structure during wildfire exposure."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What surfaces can Praetorian SmartCoat be applied to?",
        answer: "Our coatings can be applied to virtually any substrate including metal, wood, concrete, masonry, and various roofing materials. The water-based acrylic elastomeric resin provides exceptional adhesion while maintaining flexibility during thermal expansion/contraction cycles with 156% elongation capability (exceeding the standard 100% requirement)."
      },
      {
        question: "How are the coatings applied?",
        answer: "Application methods include airless sprayer (recommended for large areas), roller (suitable for most surfaces), or brush (for detail work). The coverage rate is approximately 80-100 sq ft per gallon depending on surface texture. Drying time is 1-2 hours to touch, 2-4 hours minimum before recoating, with full cure in 5-7 days."
      },
      {
        question: "What certifications do your products have?",
        answer: "Our products comply with ASTM E84 (fire testing), ASTM D6083 (waterproofing), ASTM E1269 (thermal properties), and ASTM E1461-92 (thermal diffusivity). They are verified by the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) with 89% reflection and 89% emittance, and hold Energy Star certification, Factory Mutual Class A fire rating, and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) certification for marine applications."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the ROI and payback period?",
        answer: "Typical payback periods range from 1-3 years depending on application. For example, the Sony Koda facility achieved remarkable energy consumption reduction of 87% in May (from 3,767 KW to 519 KW) with a payback period of just 1.06 years. Beyond energy savings, our coatings provide additional value through reduced maintenance costs, extended asset life, and multi-functional benefits."
