        question: "What makes Praetorian SmartCoat different from other protective coatings?",
        answer: "Praetorian SmartCoat is a cutting-edge ceramic insulating coating that combines a proprietary ceramic microsphere technology with durable acrylic polymers to create a high-performance protective membrane. The coating provides superior thermal insulation, waterproofing, and fire resistance for a wide range of building and infrastructure applications."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the ceramic technology actually work?",
        answer: "Our ceramic microsphere technology contains millions of hollow ceramic microspheres embedded within an acrylic polymer matrix. These microspheres trap air, a natural insulator, reducing heat transfer through roofs and walls. The coating also has reflective properties with light colors and ceramic particles that reflect solar radiation, minimizing heat absorption. According to testing, our coating has a Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) of 85-92%."
      },
      {
        question: "What kind of temperature reduction can I expect?",
        answer: "Thermal imaging studies have shown roofs treated with Praetorian Smart-Coat typically show up to 30°F (17°C) lower surface temperatures compared to untreated controls under peak summer conditions. This temperature reduction helps decrease cooling costs and improves comfort inside buildings. The actual energy efficiency improvements will vary depending on the specific application and environmental conditions."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do Praetorian SmartCoat products last?",
        answer: "Our coatings have a typical shelf life of 12 months when unopened and stored properly between 5°C and 30°C. Once applied, the service life depends on the application environment and maintenance. The durability of the coating is one of its strengths, resisting cracking, peeling, and degradation from environmental stresses such as UV exposure, thermal cycling, and chemical pollutants. This durability reduces maintenance frequency and costs over time."

    category: "Fire Protection",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What fire ratings do your coatings have?",
        answer: "Our coatings achieve a Class A fire rating per ASTM E108 / UL 790. When tested according to ASTM E84 standards for surface burning characteristics, the coating demonstrated excellent fire retardancy. The coating's fire resistance properties have been validated through extensive laboratory testing and real-world applications, making it suitable for fire protection applications."
      },
      {
        question: "How do your coatings perform in extreme heat?",
        answer: "Our coatings are designed to provide thermal protection under high-temperature conditions. The ceramic components in the coating help slow flame spread and reduce heat transfer. Testing according to ASTM D2485-18 for high-temperature service has shown good performance. This thermal resistance helps protect the underlying structure during high-heat events."
      },
      {
        question: "What thickness is required for effective coating performance?",
        answer: "Our coatings are typically applied at a dry film thickness of 20-40 mils (500-1000 microns), depending on the specific application and performance requirements. This thickness range provides an optimal balance of thermal insulation, waterproofing, and fire resistance properties. The coating can be applied using conventional methods such as airless spray (preferred for large surfaces), roller, or brush for detail work."
      },
      {
        question: "Are these coatings suitable for wildfire protection?",
        answer: "Yes, our coatings can provide protection in wildfire-prone areas. The Class A fire rating combined with the thermal resistance properties makes them suitable for structures in high-risk zones. The ceramic microsphere technology creates a thermal barrier that can help reduce heat transfer to the underlying structure during fire exposure. When properly applied, the coating provides an additional layer of protection as part of a comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What surfaces can Praetorian SmartCoat be applied to?",
        answer: "Our coatings can be applied to a variety of substrates including metal, concrete, wood, and various roofing materials. Adhesion testing (ASTM D4541) has demonstrated strong adhesion to these materials. The coating cures into a seamless, flexible membrane that resists water penetration, UV radiation, and temperature extremes, helping to extend the service life of the surfaces it protects."
      },
      {
        question: "How are the coatings applied?",
        answer: "Application methods include airless spray (preferred for uniform coverage on large surfaces), roller (suitable for smaller areas and touch-ups), or brush (used for edges and detailed work). Surfaces must be clean, dry, and free of contaminants before application. Drying time is typically 1-2 hours touch dry, with full cure achieved in 24-48 hours under normal conditions."
      },
      {
        question: "What certifications do your products have?",
        answer: "Our products have been tested according to ASTM E84-23 (surface burning characteristics), ASTM D2485-18 (high temperature service), ASTM D2794-93(2019) (impact resistance), and ASTM E119-22 (fire resistance) protocols. The coating meets Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) requirements and has been tested for water resistance (ASTM D2247) showing no blistering or loss of adhesion after extended humidity exposure."
      },
      {
        question: "What benefits does Praetorian Smart-Coat provide?",
        answer: "Praetorian Smart-Coat offers multiple benefits including superior thermal insulation that can reduce cooling costs, waterproofing properties that prevent leaks and moisture damage, fire resistance that enhances building occupant safety, and durability that resists environmental stresses such as UV exposure and thermal cycling. These combined features help protect your investment and can contribute to reduced maintenance costs over time."
