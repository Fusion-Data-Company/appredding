      {
        question: "What makes Praetorian coatings different from other brands?",
        answer: "Praetorian protective coatings are engineered with advanced polymer technology that provides superior durability, weather resistance, and longevity. Our formulations undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet the highest standards for performance in extreme environments, offering protection that significantly outlasts conventional coatings."
      },
      {
        question: "Are your products environmentally friendly?",
        answer: "Yes, we prioritize environmental responsibility. Our coatings are formulated with low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) content, meeting or exceeding regulatory standards. Many of our products are water-based rather than solvent-based, reducing air pollution and creating a safer application environment."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do your protective coatings last?",
        answer: "The longevity depends on the specific product and application environment. Our marine coatings typically last 7-10 years before requiring maintenance, while our construction coatings can provide 15+ years of protection. Our fire-resistant coatings maintain their protective properties for 10-15 years in normal conditions."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer color customization for your products?",
        answer: "Absolutely. While we have a standard color palette, we can customize colors to match specific requirements for most of our coating systems. Our color-matching technology ensures consistent results across batches for large-scale projects."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Can I apply Praetorian coatings myself, or do I need a professional?",
        answer: "While some of our products are suitable for DIY application, we generally recommend professional application through our certified painter network for optimal results, especially for specialized coatings like fire protection or marine applications. Professional application ensures proper surface preparation, correct film thickness, and adherence to warranty requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "What surface preparation is required before applying your coatings?",
        answer: "Proper surface preparation is critical for coating performance. Requirements vary by substrate and product, but generally include cleaning, removing loose material, addressing previous coatings, and applying appropriate primers. Our certified painters are trained in proper preparation techniques specific to each coating system."
      },
      {
        question: "How are fire-resistant coatings applied?",
        answer: "Our fire-resistant coatings require precise application to achieve their rated performance. Application methods include spray, roller, or brush depending on the specific product and area. Intumescent coatings typically require multiple coats to achieve the specified thickness necessary for their fire-resistance rating."
      },
      {
        question: "How soon can a surface be used after coating application?",
        answer: "Dry time and cure time vary by product. Most coatings are dry to touch within 2-4 hours, but full curing generally takes 5-7 days depending on temperature and humidity. Heavy-duty applications like floor coatings may require longer curing periods before returning to full service."
