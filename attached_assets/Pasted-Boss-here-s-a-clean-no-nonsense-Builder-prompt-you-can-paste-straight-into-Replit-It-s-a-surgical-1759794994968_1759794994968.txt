Boss, here‚Äôs a clean, no-nonsense Builder prompt you can paste straight into Replit. It‚Äôs a surgical to-do list with exact steps, selectors, copy, and acceptance checks so the agent doesn‚Äôt get cute and ‚Äúreimagine‚Äù your site.

‚∏ª

üîß Replit Builder ‚Äî Targeted Fix List (Advance Power Redding)

Objective: Apply the following UI/content fixes without altering existing layout, spacing rhythm, or component structure. Maintain the current dark theme everywhere. Do not introduce light mode or responsive surprises.

Phase 0 ‚Äî Repo Scan & Safety Rails
	1.	Detect tech & structure:
	‚Ä¢	Identify framework (likely React/Vite/Next) and find components:
	‚Ä¢	Hero / HeroMarquee / Badge / ThemeProvider
	‚Ä¢	Any ‚ÄúCommon Solar Panel Issues‚Äù section component (e.g., IssuesCard.tsx)
	‚Ä¢	Locate global theming: CSS variables, Tailwind config, or ThemeProvider toggles.
	2.	Create a branch fix/hero-badge-theme-issues-card.
	3.	Guardrails:
	‚Ä¢	Do not change grid/stack order.
	‚Ä¢	Only update styling tokens, classNames, small offsets.
	‚Ä¢	Keep all existing content except the explicit replacements below.

‚∏ª

Phase 1 ‚Äî Badge Icon: Replace Rotating Wrench with Sun

Goal: In the hero badge, replace the wrench icon with a sun icon. No spin animation unless it already exists (keep or remove spin per current style consistency).
	‚Ä¢	Where: The hero badge component (search for ‚Äúwrench‚Äù, ‚Äúfa-wrench‚Äù, ‚Äúlucide Wrench‚Äù, or IconWrench).
	‚Ä¢	Change: Swap to a sun icon from the existing icon set (Lucide/Font Awesome/Custom).
	‚Ä¢	If Lucide: import { Sun } from "lucide-react"
	‚Ä¢	Replace <Wrench .../> with <Sun className="h-4 w-4 opacity-90" aria-hidden />
	‚Ä¢	Keep styling: Same size/opacity/margins as existing icon so layout doesn‚Äôt shift.

Acceptance:
	‚Ä¢	Hero badge renders a sun icon.
	‚Ä¢	No layout shift or text wrap change.

‚∏ª

Phase 2 ‚Äî Global Copy Fix (‚ÄúAdvance Power Redding‚Äù)

Goal: Replace all visible instances of ‚ÄúAdvance Power of Redding‚Äù with ‚ÄúAdvance Power Redding‚Äù (exactly this text), without touching code identifiers.
	‚Ä¢	Do:
	‚Ä¢	Content-level find & replace for display strings only:
	‚Ä¢	"Advance Power of Redding" ‚Üí "Advance Power Redding"
	‚Ä¢	Skip variables, file names, routes, interfaces.
	‚Ä¢	Run: Case-sensitive replace in UI copy files only (.tsx/.jsx/.md/.json content config).

Acceptance:
	‚Ä¢	No remaining ‚Äúof‚Äù in visible site copy.
	‚Ä¢	No broken imports/identifiers/routes.

‚∏ª

Phase 3 ‚Äî Force Dark Theme Everywhere

Goal: Site must not flip to light on any device. Current dark styling should be the only mode.
	‚Ä¢	Steps:
	1.	If using a theme provider (e.g., next-themes):
	‚Ä¢	Set defaultTheme="dark", enableSystem={false}, attribute="class".
	‚Ä¢	Remove any theme toggle UI and any prefers-color-scheme logic.
	2.	Ensure html or body always carries the dark class.
	3.	Confirm CSS variables for dark are defined at root, not conditionally.
	4.	Remove light-mode overrides or ensure they never apply.
	‚Ä¢	Hardening: If any CSS depends on @media (prefers-color-scheme: light), neutralize or ensure dark tokens override them last.

Acceptance (on Windows/macOS/iOS/Android, Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox):
	‚Ä¢	No light palette anywhere.
	‚Ä¢	Typography, buttons, cards look exactly like the current dark reference.

‚∏ª

Phase 4 ‚Äî Hero Photo Scroll (Marquee) Cut-off Fix

Goal: Scrolling images aren‚Äôt clipped. Give the marquee breathing room so all images are fully visible during scroll.
	‚Ä¢	Where: Hero marquee container (look for classes with overflow-hidden, fixed heights, or negative margins).
	‚Ä¢	Changes:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure container allows visibility:
	‚Ä¢	If clipping occurs, change overflow: hidden to overflow: visible; on the container that clips images, not on the scroll track.
	‚Ä¢	Add vertical space:
	‚Ä¢	Increase padding-top and/or margin-top by 12‚Äì24px (start +12px; iterate until fully visible).
	‚Ä¢	Set a stable height for the track if needed:
	‚Ä¢	e.g., min-height: clamp(180px, 22vh, 320px);
	‚Ä¢	Ensure image items have object-fit: cover; and no transform scale causing crop beyond container.
	‚Ä¢	No layout changes: Keep horizontal flow and speed.

Acceptance (deployed build):
	‚Ä¢	Marquee images are never cut off at top or bottom.
	‚Ä¢	No overlap with headings or CTAs.
	‚Ä¢	Mobile and desktop both clean.

‚∏ª

Phase 5 ‚Äî Purple ‚ÄúBadge‚Äù Still Styled Like a Button

Goal: Convert the remaining purple ‚Äúbadge‚Äù on the main page into a true badge using the badge decoration standard already used elsewhere (shape, border, glow, typographic scale).
	‚Ä¢	Steps:
	1.	Find the rogue purple element (search for ‚Äúpurple‚Äù, ‚Äúbtn‚Äù, or inline background class).
	2.	Replace button classes with the standard badge class/style mixin already used in the hero badge.
	‚Ä¢	Rounded-full or pill, thin border (1px) with subtle inner shadow, slight glow, small caps/label scale.
	3.	Set correct color token to match badge standard (not brand button color).
	‚Ä¢	Example Tailwind tokens (adjust to your design system):
	‚Ä¢	bg-[radial-gradient(ellipse_at_top,_var(--tw-gradient-stops))] from-[#B71C1C]/70 via-[#7A0A0A]/60 to-[#340606]/60
	‚Ä¢	border-white/10, backdrop-blur-[2px], shadow-[0_0_12px_rgba(255,255,255,0.06)]
	4.	Keep text contrast AA+ (use off-white).

Acceptance:
	‚Ä¢	The purple element visually matches the badge standard, not a button.
	‚Ä¢	Hover/active states are subtle (opacity shift only), no ‚Äúbutton press‚Äù animation.

‚∏ª

Phase 6 ‚Äî ‚ÄúCommon Solar Panel Issues‚Äù Card Upgrade

Goal: Turn the existing blue right-side one-column list into a metallic red ‚Äúpain‚Äù card with richer content and balanced layout (no skinny column). Fill the box visually without changing the global grid.
	‚Ä¢	Where: Section titled ‚ÄúCommon Solar Panel Issues‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Style Update:
	‚Ä¢	Background: metallic red panel with depth.
	‚Ä¢	Example utility stack:
	‚Ä¢	bg-[conic-gradient(from_210deg_at_50%_50%,#540808_0%,#7E0B0B_35%,#B51212_60%,#7E0B0B_82%,#540808_100%)]
	‚Ä¢	before: sheen overlay (optional): absolute pseudo with subtle diagonal gradient at low opacity.
	‚Ä¢	border border-white/10 rounded-2xl p-6 md:p-8
	‚Ä¢	shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.06),0_6px_24px_rgba(181,18,18,0.25)]
	‚Ä¢	Text: headings text-white, body text-white/80.
	‚Ä¢	Layout: two-column on md+ to balance density (md:grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-6), stacked on mobile.
	‚Ä¢	Content Expansion (use this copy verbatim):
Reduced energy output & efficiency loss
What it looks like: Gradual drop in daily kWh despite similar weather.
Likely causes: Soiling (dust, pollen), heat derating, UV aging.
Quick check: Compare panel temp and inverter logs vs. baseline week.
Fix path: Schedule cleaning, verify airflow, assess module age vs. warranty.
Physical damage from weather or debris
What it looks like: Cracked glass, hot spots, shading from nearby branches.
Likely causes: Hail, wind-borne debris, seasonal overgrowth.
Quick check: Visual inspection at dawn/dusk; thermal scan if available.
Fix path: Trim vegetation, replace compromised modules, add hail guards where appropriate.
Inverter malfunctions & electrical issues
What it looks like: Fault codes, nighttime draw, intermittent shutdowns.
Likely causes: DC/AC faults, ground issues, failing caps.
Quick check: Pull recent fault history; verify string voltages vs. spec.
Fix path: Firmware update, tighten lugs, RMA inverter if out of spec.
Wiring problems & connection failures
What it looks like: One string underperforming, arc faults, nuisance trips.
Likely causes: Loose MC4s, corroded lugs, rodent damage.
Quick check: IR temp delta at connectors; continuity tests per string.
Fix path: Re-terminate connectors, replace damaged runs, add conduit guards.
Monitoring errors & communication loss
What it looks like: Data gaps, offline portal, no alerts firing.
Likely causes: Gateway power loss, Wi-Fi/LAN issues, API auth lapses.
Quick check: Verify gateway LEDs, router logs, DHCP lease.
Fix path: Re-provision gateway, pin a static IP, rotate API keys and re-auth.
	‚Ä¢	HTML/JSX structure guidance:
	‚Ä¢	Keep existing parent card container, add: md:grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-6
	‚Ä¢	Wrap each issue in its own <div className="space-y-1"> with a mini title and body.
	‚Ä¢	No accordions, no tabs‚Äîflat, readable, dense.

Acceptance:
	‚Ä¢	Card is metallic red, legible, balanced 2-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.
	‚Ä¢	Content fills the card without a tall skinny column.
	‚Ä¢	Contrast verified (no pink/low contrast reds).

‚∏ª

Phase 7 ‚Äî Build & Deploy Checks
	1.	Local & Preview:
	‚Ä¢	Run build, verify dark theme, hero marquee visibility, badge icon, purple badge styling, issues card layout/content.
	2.	Deployed Verification:
	‚Ä¢	Check the production build where problems occurred.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm no device triggers light theme.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm hero marquee isn‚Äôt clipped on common breakpoints: 360, 390, 414, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440.
	3.	Regression Tests (manual OK):
	‚Ä¢	Navbar/CTA spacing unchanged.
	‚Ä¢	Forms unaffected.
	‚Ä¢	Lighthouse contrast ‚â• 4.5:1 for body text on the red card.

Implementation Hints (use only if needed, don‚Äôt overreach)
	‚Ä¢	Theme lock:

// _app.tsx or RootLayout
<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="dark" enableSystem={false}>
  <html className="dark">...</html>
</ThemeProvider>


	‚Ä¢	Hero marquee breathing room:

<div className="relative pt-6 md:pt-8">
  <div className="marquee-container overflow-visible">
    {/* keep existing scroll track */}
  </div>
</div>


	‚Ä¢	Badge class baseline (reuse existing standard):

<span className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full border border-white/10 px-3 py-1 text-xs uppercase tracking-wide backdrop-blur-[2px] shadow-[0_0_12px_rgba(255,255,255,0.06)]/">
  <Sun className="h-4 w-4 opacity-90" aria-hidden />
  Advance Power Redding
</span>
