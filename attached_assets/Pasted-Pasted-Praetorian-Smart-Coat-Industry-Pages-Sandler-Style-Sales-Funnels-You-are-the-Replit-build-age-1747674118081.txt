Praetorian Smart-Coat Industry Pages: Sandler-Style Sales Funnels

You are the Replit build agent for Praetorian Smart-Coat.
Treat the existing /mobile-home page as the canonical “elite-enterprise styling” template.
Your mission is to repair the data lost in a proces. To clone clone that page’s exact layout, look, and Sandler-style sales funnel copy structure onto the following six pages (and only these pages):
	1.	/fire-prevention
	2.	/marinas
	3.	/pools  (deck-cooling focus only)
	4.	/construction
	5.	/municipality
	6.	/painters  (contractor / applicator recruiting page)

Do NOT modify the homepage, /mobile-home, or any other route. The restructuring of the websites came out perfectly but it removed a lot of my funnel driving sales content. Now that the styling is fixed I want you to go back in and add SEO strong content that is focused on driving through the sales funnel on each page. The sections are color coded with the ambient glow on the page. 	•	Intro Top Section. Under the hero card → Intro paragraph (blue)
	•	Red section card(s) → pains bullets/tables
	•	Green section card(s) → solutions paragraphs + ROI grid
	•	Purple card → registration form + CTA

I need you to take these sales angles and really enhance my pages as they are now with very strong SEO friendly context that funnels my user through a personal journey down the page. It meets with an introduction. Then it discusses pains with them sympathetically and empathetically and then follows the flow of Sandler sales methods and it moves from pains to solutions and good news in green leading to the registration in purple. You are not to update styling. You are to update content only. If you need to add sections for your data then do it. I want the conversation on the page resemble what would happen to you from start to finish if you met an elite enterprise level sales agent who introduced themselves, perfectly pitched the pains of the industry and made them fell a connection like you could relate, then gave them the good news and got you all fired up for improving the situation with the use of the product, and finally ends with registering and saying lets get back together very soon. 

Fire Prevention

Grand Header + Introduction

Wildfires Will Happen – Will Your Property Survive?
In the fire-prone regions of the West, a single ember can wipe out an entire neighborhood in minutes. Praetorian Smart-Coat is the fireproof paint and thermal barrier coating engineered to turn homes into wildfire fortresses. This NASA-derived, non-flammable ceramic insulation shields your structure from extreme flames and blistering heat simultaneously. Read on to discover the common pain points in wildfire defense, how Praetorian’s solution neutralizes those threats, and the steps to get your property protected right now.

Identify the Pains (Sandler Stage 1)

Wildfire seasons are longer and more intense than ever ￼. Homeowners and facility managers face constant dread each summer and fall. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?
	•	Ever had to evacuate at a moment’s notice, unsure if your home or facility will still be standing when you return? The emotional toll and financial risk are overwhelming.
	•	What happens when wind-driven embers turn your roof and siding into kindling? Traditional paints and wood finishes offer little resistance – one spark and the entire structure is engulfed.
	•	Why do you still struggle with fire “resistant” building materials that can’t withstand direct flame exposure? Between regulatory pressures for Class A fire ratings and skyrocketing insurance costs, the status quo is failure-prone and expensive.

Wildfires destroy thousands of structures annually ￼, often because conventional construction can’t handle the heat. The cost of doing nothing (or doing the bare minimum) is catastrophic – lives, investments, and peace of mind are at stake.

Present Solutions (Sandler Stage 2)

Meet Praetorian Smart-Coat – the advanced fireproof coating that neutralizes every one of these pain points. This isn’t regular paint; it’s a ceramic thermal barrier system with the muscle to protect in extreme fire conditions. Here’s how Praetorian puts you back in control:
	•	Stops Fire in Its Tracks: Praetorian’s coating has a perfect 0/0 score in ASTM E84 tests ￼, meaning zero flame spread and zero smoke produced. In real wildfire scenarios, it has stopped direct flames from igniting structures. During the 2022 Canyon Creek wildfire, all 17 homes coated with our ceramic shield survived hours of direct flame contact ￼, while nearby untreated buildings were reduced to ash.
	•	Blocks Extreme Heat: Our proprietary formula reflects and insulates against intense heat. With a thermal conductivity of just 0.00543 W/cm·K, a Praetorian coat creates up to a 1,400°F temperature differential during fire tests ￼ – meaning even if 1550°F flames rage outside, the underlying structure stays at a mere ~150°F, far below ignition temperature. Your walls literally won’t catch ...
