You're going to perform a comprehensive styling overhaul on the existing webpage from top to bottom, header through footer, without stopping or asking questions mid-process. The hero section and the section immediately below it are off-limits and must remain untouched entirely. Your sole mission is to unify the rest of the page's styling to elite FANG-level enterprise standards suitable for a bright, sunshine-themed solar company website.

Styling Guidelines:

Color Scheme:

Adopt bright, sunny, and energetic color tones reflecting solar energy (e.g., vibrant yellows, oranges, subtle blues representing sky clarity).

Absolutely avoid any white or off-white text against white or very light backgrounds to ensure readability. Text must always have clear and vibrant contrast.

Typography:

Standardize all fonts to a professional, modern typeface with enhanced readability suitable for elite enterprise levels. Use subtle drop shadows for headers to elevate visual appeal.

Ensure font sizes, weights, and spacing are consistent, professional, and optimized.

Buttons:

Precisely replicate the existing "WHY GO SOLAR" button styling from the pop-out pitch deck for every button on the page. Include its exact color, shape, gradient, subtle shadowing, and interactive hover effects.

Section Cohesion:

Ensure seamless transitions between sections using subtle yet elegant animated transitions such as fade-ins or smooth sliding effects, enhancing user experience without overwhelming.

Consistently apply spacing, padding, margins, and alignment according to elite-level enterprise design standards.

Cards and Containers:

Upgrade every card and container element to elite styling:

Rounded corners, refined shadows for depth, and consistent padding.

Background gradients or subtle solar-themed textures emphasizing brightness and clarity, reinforcing the sunny aesthetic.

Header and Footer:

Style both header and footer according to the guidelines above, maintaining the sunny, vibrant theme and complementing overall design aesthetics.

Elite Animations and Interactive Styling:

Introduce subtle, engaging animations like slight hover enlargements on interactive elements, smooth fade-ins of content, and gentle parallax scrolling effects where appropriate to maintain viewer engagement without distracting from content.

Execution Directive:

Perform a single continuous execution of the entire task from start to finish without interruption.

Absolutely no follow-up questions or requests for clarification. Complete the task thoroughly, fully, and precisely.

The result must embody polished professionalism and visually communicate elite-level enterprise styling standards appropriate for a solar company.

Execute this prompt exactly as instructed, immediately.
