Buttons inside each section inherit that section’s glow class — confirm this on /mobile-home.

⸻

5. “BIG ENGAGING HEADER” RULE
	•	Each page must start with a full-width .glow-blue hero card (same height, gradient headline, sub-headline as /mobile-home).
	•	If a target page’s first element is not that hero card, insert a brand-new hero card (copied from /mobile-home) at the very top.

⸻

6. SEO & JSON-LD (copy /mobile-home pattern)
	•	Update <title> → Praetorian Smart-Coat | {Industry} | Fireproof Ceramic Paint
	•	Update <meta name="description"> with 150-160-char summary using keyword Praetorian + industry term.
	•	Duplicate /mobile-home’s Product JSON-LD block → change industry, name fields. Leave aggregateRating blank.

⸻

7. FORM TEST & CRM CHECK
	•	Keep the existing <form action="/api/lead"> markup.
	•	Ensure hidden <input name="industry" value="{slug}"> matches each page slug.
	•	After updates, perform an automated POST with dummy data and confirm HTTP 200 response + CRM entry (mock console.info("[crm-ok] {slug}")).
	•	Auto-repair if submission fails, then retest.

⸻

8. VALIDATION SCRIPT (RUN PER PAGE, LOOP UNTIL PASS)
	1.	Exactly one .glow-blue hero card exists first.
	2.	At least one .glow-red, .glow-green, .glow-purple in proper order.
	3.	No DOM elements of any other color between .glow-purple and page end.
	4.	No TS/Next compile warnings.
	5.	All CTA buttons animate & route identical to /mobile-home.
	6.	Form submission OK.

If any test fails, fix automatically and re-run validation before moving to next page.

⸻

9. CONTINUOUS EXECUTION & CHECKPOINTS
	•	Tag checkpoints with console.info("[checkpoint] {slug} done").
	•	If Replit UI times out, user will type continue; resume at last checkpoint automatically.
	•	No human prompts mid-process.

⸻

10. FINAL MICROSCOPE PASS
