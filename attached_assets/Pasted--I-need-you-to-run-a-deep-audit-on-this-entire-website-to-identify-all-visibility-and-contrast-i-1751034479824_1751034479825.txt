ðŸš¨ I need you to run a deep audit on this entire website to identify **all visibility and contrast issues** that make text hard or impossible to read.

DO NOT FIX ANYTHING YET â€” I only want a full diagnostic report.

---

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE:
Scan every page, style, and element in the entire project and detect:

1. **Low-contrast text**:
   - Any combination of text color and background color that fails WCAG 2.1 AA standards:
     - < 4.5:1 for regular text
     - < 3:1 for large/bold text
   - Examples: white on white, light gray on gray, #ccc on #fff, light blue on light green, etc.

2. **Overlapping styles** that obscure text:
   - Positioning conflicts (`position: absolute`, `z-index`, etc.)
   - Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) blocking or overlaying content
   - Backgrounds with opacity, images, gradients, or parallax layers that lower visibility

3. **Responsive layout issues** that break readability:
   - Mobile view causing text to overlay backgrounds poorly
   - Collapsed boxes or wrapped sections hiding content

ðŸ”¬ HOW TO SCAN:

1. Parse every HTML, template, and component file in the project (`.html`, `.ejs`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, etc.)
2. For every element that contains text:
   - Identify computed text color and background color (inherited or direct)
   - Determine actual rendered contrast ratio
   - Note if the background is:
     - a solid color
     - a gradient
     - a transparent layer
     - an image
   - Check if any other elements (divs, overlays, z-indexed containers) are blocking or fading text
3. Include mobile and tablet breakpoints in your analysis (responsive layout)

ðŸ“‹ OUTPUT FORMAT (for each issue found):

- Page/File:
- Element Selector (class/id/tag):
- Text (if visible):
- Computed Text Color:
- Computed Background Color:
- Contrast Ratio:
- Visibility Problem Summary (e.g., grey on grey, text blocked by image, white on gradient, etc.):
- Style Source (inline/class + file name & line number if possible)

Example:
Page: services.html  
Selector: .feature-box p  
Text: "Complete energy audit"  
Text Color: #cccccc  
Background: #eeeeee  
Contrast Ratio: 1.29 (FAIL)  
Problem: Low contrast â€” light gray on light gray background  
CSS Source: /styles/main.css line 152

ðŸ“Œ NOTE:
- Do NOT make any style changes yet.
- Do NOT skip any banners, footers, modals, or hidden sections.
- This is a visibility audit â€” be precise, complete, and include exact locations and contrast scores.

Iâ€™ll ask for targeted fixes once the report is generated.
