PRAETORIAN SMART-COAT — BULK PAGE UPGRADE

/mobile-home IS THE GOLD STANDARD — REPRODUCE IT EXACTLY

You are the Replit build-automation agent.
Execute ALL steps without pausing for clarification.
If the UI times out, resume automatically from the last checkpoint when the user types continue.

Pages to update (leave all others untouched)

/fire-prevention
/marinas
/pools  (deck-cooling focus only)
/construction
/municipality
/painters  (contractor recruiting)

The homepage and /mobile-home remain read-only references.

⸻

1. COPY — DON’T INVENT
	•	For every style or component decision: open /mobile-home, copy the identical markup, class names, glow colors, shadows, hover animations, button styles, icon sizes, and spacing.
	•	Modify text, icons, and hero image only where industry-specific.
	•	If unsure, re-inspect /mobile-home; do not ask the user.

⸻

2. FOUR-STAGE SANDLER FUNNEL (COLOR-CODED)
	1.	Intro — blue glow (.glow-blue)
	•	Hero card at page top with gradient headline, cinematic sub-headline, and a 60-word introduction.
	2.	Pains — red glow (.glow-red)
	•	Three to four pain-question bullets, each with a Lucide icon (copy bullet layout from template).
	3.	Solutions + Benefits — green glow (.glow-green)
	•	Two solution paragraphs explaining how Praetorian removes the pains.
	•	Three succinct benefit lines (can include ROI metric).
	4.	Registration / Close — purple glow (.glow-purple)
	•	One urgency line.
	•	Registration form posting to /api/lead with hidden industry field set to the slug.
	•	CTA button uses section’s purple glow.
	•	On /painters page change CTA text to “Apply to Become a Certified Praetorian Painter”.

Maintain the exact vertical order: blue, red, green, purple.

⸻

3. HERO HEADER RULE

Each target page must begin with a dedicated full-width blue-glow hero card.
If absent, create one (do not repurpose a badge).

⸻

4. SEO & STRUCTURED DATA
	•	<title>: Praetorian Smart-Coat | {Industry} | Fireproof Ceramic Paint
	•	<meta name="description">: 150-160 characters with keywords “Praetorian” and the industry term.
	•	Copy the JSON-LD “Product” block from /mobile-home; update name and industry. Leave aggregateRating blank.

⸻

5. FORM TEST

For each page:
	1.	Submit a headless POST with dummy data.
	2.	Confirm HTTP 200 response and that payload logs console.info("[crm-ok] {slug}").
	3.	Retry up to three times; if still failing, auto-repair form markup and retest.

⸻

6. VALIDATION & AUTO-FIX LOOP

For every page, programmatically confirm:
	•	Exactly one blue hero card is first element.
	•	At least one red, one green, and one purple section exist and are in correct order.
	•	No other elements appear after the purple section.
	•	Registration form action and hidden industry are correct.
	•	Page compiles with zero TypeScript / Next warnings.

On failure, self-fix, then rerun validation until it passes.

⸻

7. CONTINUOUS EXECUTION & CHECKPOINTS
	•	After finishing each page, log console.info("[checkpoint] {slug} done").
	•	Resume automatically after user types continue if the UI session times out.
	•	Do not prompt the user for help.

⸻

8. FINAL MICROSCOPE PASS
	•	Diff every updated page’s DOM/CSS/JS against /mobile-home for class parity, glow intensity, hover timing, spacing, and button animation ease values.
	•	Auto-sync any deviation, re-validate, then proceed.

⸻

9. COMMIT & REPORT
	•	When all six pages pass validation, form tests, and diff checks, commit with message
feat: sync six industry pages to /mobile-home elite template and Sandler funnel.
	•	Finally output exactly:
✅ All Pages Updated, Verified, Forms OK — Commit Complete

No other chatter or questions.
