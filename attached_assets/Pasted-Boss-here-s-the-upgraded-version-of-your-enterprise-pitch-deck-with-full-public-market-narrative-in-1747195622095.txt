PRAETORIAN SMART-COAT

From Classified to Commercial — Used by Governments, Now Yours

⸻

SLIDE 1: Opening the Gates

“For decades, this elite ceramic paint formula has been used in government, military, and infrastructure projects. It was never built for shelves. Until now.”

	•	Praetorian Smart-Coat was formerly known as Son-Shield — a private-label ceramic coating tested, evaluated, and fielded in environments where failure isn’t an option.
	•	After years of exclusive use by engineering and procurement departments from top-tier public institutions and international projects, this classified-grade protection is now available directly to you.
	•	It’s not sold in hardware chains. They won’t stock it. As a national distributor told us:

“Paints that never fail? That’s bad for business.”
