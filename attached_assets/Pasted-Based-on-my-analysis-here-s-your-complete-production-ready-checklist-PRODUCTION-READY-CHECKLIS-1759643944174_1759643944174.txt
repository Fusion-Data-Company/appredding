Based on my analysis, here's your complete production-ready checklist:

ðŸŽ¯ PRODUCTION-READY CHECKLIST
1. CRITICAL: Form Type Errors (40 LSP Diagnostics)
Pages affected: ResidentialSolar.tsx, CommercialSolar.tsx, HybridSolar.tsx, Repairs.tsx, Contact.tsx

Problem: Forms are using wrong schema - insertFirePreventionHomeownerSchema expects different field names

Schema wants: firstName, lastName (not name)
Schema wants: specific fields, not generic message field
API endpoint mismatch in mutations
Fix Required:

 Update form schemas to match actual form fields OR
 Update form fields to match schema expectations
 Fix default values in useForm() (lines 80-89 in ResidentialSolar.tsx)
 Fix FormField names (line 1390: "name" should be "firstName"/"lastName")
 Fix FormField names (line 1442: "message" field doesn't exist in schema)
 Remove unused state: showConsultationForm, setShowConsultationForm (line 74)
2. Social Media / OG Image (Graph Logo)
Current: Default image is /meta-images/hero-image-social-preview-may-2025.jpg (doesn't exist)
User wants: Graph image for social media sharing

Fix Required:

 Create or upload the graph image you want for social sharing (1200x630px optimal)
 Save to: public/meta-images/graph-social-share.jpg
 Update SEOHead.tsx default image (line 18): Change from hero-image-social-preview-may-2025.jpg to your graph image filename
 Test with Facebook Sharing Debugger
 Test with Twitter Card Validator
3. Mobile Responsiveness
A. Header/Navigation Issues
 Add mobile padding to body - MainLayout needs pt-[80px] or similar to prevent header overlap
 Test mobile menu at 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px widths
 Ensure mobile menu has scroll locking when open
 Verify dropdown menus work on touch devices
B. Hero Sections
All hero components need responsive text sizing:

 Update large headings: text-3xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl (instead of fixed text-6xl)
 Convert multi-column grids to single column on mobile: grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
 Test stats sections and feature grids on 320px screens
 Reduce blur effects on mobile for performance (12px vs 24px desktop)
C. Forms & CTAs
 Ensure all buttons have minimum touch target (44px height)
 Test all forms on mobile screens
 Verify form inputs are properly sized and spaced
 Check that CTAs aren't hidden by mobile navigation
4. Performance & Console Errors
A. Framer Motion Warnings
Current: "Please ensure that the container has a non-static position..."

 Add className="relative" to all hero section wrapper containers
 Ensure scroll-linked components have position: relative parent
B. Cross-Origin Script Errors
Current: Multiple "Script error." messages

 Add crossorigin="anonymous" to external scripts in client/index.html
 Verify global error handler filters these (already implemented but double-check)
5. Production Build & Testing
 Run TypeScript check: npx tsc --noEmit (should show zero errors)
 Test production build: npm run build
 Run Lighthouse audit (mobile): Target LCP < 2.5s
 Verify all 32 pages load without errors
 Test all navigation links and dropdowns
 Verify all images load correctly (including ProductComparison - âœ… already fixed)
6. Final Pre-Launch Checklist
 Verify security headers enabled (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
 Confirm compression/caching middleware active
 Test error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully
 Verify sitemap.xml is up to date with all routes
 Check robots.txt configuration
 Test SEO meta tags on all major pages
 Verify structured data (Schema.org) validates
 Test social sharing on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn
 Final cross-browser test (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
 Final mobile device test (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
ðŸ“Š PRIORITY ORDER
ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY (Blocks Launch):

Fix form type errors (40 LSP diagnostics)
Add/update social media graph image
Fix mobile header padding overlap
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important but not blocking):
4. Responsive text and grid layouts

Framer Motion container positioning
ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Polish):
6. Cross-origin script error filtering

Final performance optimizations
Ready to fix these? I can tackle them systematically if you switch me to Build mode. We'll start with the critical form errors, then handle the social media image, then mobile responsiveness.
