\b 7. Troubleshooting Guide\b0\par
Inverter LCD not powering on: Ensure at least one power source (PV, battery, grid) is present; check disconnects.\par
No PV power: PV voltage must be \lang1033\endash\lang9 150–170VDC; check PV disconnect, polarity, and breakers.\par
Low PV output: Battery may be full (PV throttled); check MPPT input wiring and sun conditions.\par
Battery not charging: Confirm charge settings, battery voltage, and comms if closed-loop.\par
Generator auto-start not working: Verify 2-wire start, correct wiring, generator type, and settings.\par
Alarm LED on: Review alarms via LCD; lookup fault code in table above.\par
CT readings reversed: Use Auto-Learn or flip CT orientation.\par
