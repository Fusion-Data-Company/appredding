Had them quote me on solar and, while I ended up not buying solar at all, the staff were extremely helpful. The quote was well organized, provided me with a lot of information, and the no-pressure sales was a welcome change.

If I do ever decide to put solar on my house, I'm definitely going with Advance Power Redding.

My one star review: 3 Strikes and you're out. Darn it. I liked these people. Yet after several blunders I cannot recommend. They installed my array 1.5 years ago. The salesman was great. Easy to work with. When the team came to install, the foreman was testy and argued about where to install despite what the salesman and I agreed to. Ultimately he relented but was very rude. When they did the trenching, they did not compact the fill. Ultimately, when it rained it left a deep trench across my driveway. I call the salesman. He came out and agreed it was not right and promised to fix it the next day! They never showed up. Recently I thought about adding 8 panels (they undersized the array). I ask to get an estimate, no one ever called. Don't waste your time with these folks.

Addendum: They did come out, apologized for issues, and gave a great bid. Sometimes we need to forgive mistakes.

I have had they extreme pleasure of working with Greg and his crew on a small project that started with 1 panel and it grew into a system that ran a house as well as a couple outbuilding s with a washer, drier, refrigerator, freezer, a submersible well pump and even a small milking machine. Greg not only kept everything affordable, but also provided and education that made adding on to the system a breeze. Now another but larger project looms on the horizon, the first and ONLY call will be to Advanced Power. That should be the call you make as well.

These Guys rock!. Professional people who do a quality job. I am now fully off grid and functioning with a piece of mind that came to me at a great price. Very professional staff, great communication throughout every step of the process. There was a fire that threatened my home and burned my property on the same day installation was to take place, their communication as paramount. They called each morning willing to do the job that day, because we had missed the appointment, they came out within hours of the roads being opened back up and were very supportive of my situation. They also handled all of my solar permits with ease and kept me in the loop at every step. Their installation is VERY clean and sanitary, everything is routed perfectly. I have told everyone how great Advanced Power and their staff is. We will be doing business in the future for sure! Major thanks to Greg, Berek, Everett, Pete, everyone at advanced power for their top notch communication skills and workmanship!

Had them install solar panels at our house in May, 2017. First Class service. Did what they promised, when promised, with no surprises. Workers were tidy and respectful. Anthony and Berek kept us informed and answered all our questions throughout design and installation. System performs as promised. Definitely recommend.
