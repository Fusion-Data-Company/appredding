Bottom line: Praetorian Smart-Coat isn’t just a coating—it’s a high-efficiency energy retrofit, fire shield, waterproof barrier, and asset life extender all in one. That means multiple revenue and savings channels built into a single job.

🎯 ROI Principles That Are Actually True

1. Energy Savings = Monthly Payback
	•	Most buildings coated with Praetorian Smart-Coat see 25–35% drops in HVAC energy usage within weeks.
	•	Independent DOE-backed studies on Joe Raver’s formula confirmed up to 66% heat flux reduction through roofs.
	•	That means you’re putting money back into the client’s pocket every month—a recurring ROI from day one.

📈 Typical payback period: 2–5 years depending on climate, square footage, and HVAC setup.

2. Deferred Capital Expenditures = Delayed Big Costs
	•	Roof near end of life? This coating extends roof life by 10–15+ years, postponing costly tear-offs.
	•	Building too hot in summer? With Smart-Coat, you may downsize HVAC needs for new builds—cheaper upfront.

📊 Saving $20K–$100K+ in capex on large facilities isn’t unusual.

3. Maintenance Cost Reduction
	•	Seals small cracks, prevents UV damage, and resists chalking.
	•	No need to repaint or reseal for a decade or more.

🛠️ Standard elastomeric coatings might need replacement every 5–7 years. Praetorian doubles that.

4. Fireproofing as Insurance ROI
	•	Class A fire-rated with zero flame spread and smoke index.
	•	For fire-prone zones (California, Southwest), this can lower insurance premiums or help avoid coverage issues.

🔥 Also helps with WUI (Wildland-Urban Interface) compliance in new developments.

💰 ROI Examples by Industry Segment

🏠 Homeowners

ROI Drivers:
	•	20–30% lower cooling bills
	•	More comfort without running A/C
	•	Mold and leak prevention = fewer repairs
Example:

A 2,200 sq. ft. home in Redding, CA saw cooling costs drop by $85/month during peak summer after coating. That’s $1,000+ in annual energy savings—ROI in 3–4 years, without any roof tear-off.

⸻

🎨 Painters & Contractors

ROI Drivers:
	•	High-margin upsell (adds $1.50–$2.50/sq ft vs. $0.75/sq ft for regular paint)
	•	Less callbacks (fewer peeling/cracking issues)
	•	Premium positioning (you’re not just painting, you’re coating for performance)
Pitch Tip:

“You’re not just painting a house—you’re cutting their power bill, sealing their roof, and fireproofing their siding in one move. You’re giving them back $3–4 for every $1 they spend.”

⸻

🏗️ Large Developers & GCs

ROI Drivers:
	•	Meets energy code & cool roof standards without complex assembly
	•	Lower HVAC loads = smaller equipment = big savings across hundreds of homes
	•	LEED points, sustainability credit, wildfire resistance
Example:

A developer of 120 single-family homes in Phoenix can spec Praetorian Smart-Coat to meet solar reflectance criteria AND cut HVAC sizing by 1 SEER level. Over the entire development, that’s ~$150K in HVAC savings + higher energy compliance rating + improved wildfire zone sellability.

⸻

⚓ Dock Owners, Marinas, Harbor Authorities

ROI Drivers:
	•	Metal and concrete protected from rust, corrosion, and UV degradation
	•	High reflectivity = cooler work surfaces (less thermal expansion fatigue)
	•	Fire protection on docks, walkways, fuel areas
Example:

A coastal dock owner using Smart-Coat on galvanized guardrails and stairwells saw corrosion reduced by 70% over 5 years. Fire inspectors noted improved containment zones near fuel storage—potential to prevent total loss during fire events.

🔁 How to Say It in the Field (No Lying)

“You’re not just getting paint—you’re buying insulation, fire protection, and waterproofing in one. It pays you back through lower energy bills, fewer repairs, and a longer life for what you already own.”

“This is NASA-grade thermal control on your roof. It’s not cheap—but it pays for itself, and then some.”

“You can keep patching leaks and repainting every few years, or use this once and not worry about it for a decade.”

“With this on your walls or roof, you’re not just fighting the sun—you’re winning.”
