Praetorian Smart-Coat Executive Pitch Deck

Slide 1: Challenges & Solution Overview
	•	Infrastructure at Risk: Bridges, buildings, and critical assets face extreme heat, fire hazards, corrosion, and wear. Traditional paints and coatings fail under high temperatures or harsh weather, leading to structural damage and high maintenance costs.
	•	Our Solution – Praetorian Smart-Coat: A ceramic-based smart coating that addresses these challenges head-on. Recently rebranded from the proven Son-Shield formula, Praetorian Smart-Coat provides military-grade protection against fire, heat, and degradation. It creates a defensive shield on any surface – keeping the heat out, the fire away, and the rust at bay ￼ ￼.

Slide 2: What is Praetorian Smart-Coat?
	•	High-Performance Ceramic Coating: A patented water-based coating filled with microscopic hollow ceramic beads for superior insulation ￼ ￼. Appears like paint, but acts like an armored layer.
	•	Rebranding Legacy: Formerly known as Son-Shield, this coating has been reimagined as Praetorian Smart-Coat to emphasize its role in safeguarding critical infrastructure. Same trusted formulation – now with an elevated mission and brand.
	•	Key Properties: Elastic, breathable membrane that adheres to metal, concrete, wood, even fabric. Flexible (won’t crack), eco-friendly (low-VOC, water cleanup) ￼, and highly durable (decades-long service life without recoat) ￼.
	•	Industrial-Military Aesthetic: Named “Praetorian” for a reason – it’s designed as the ultimate guard for your assets, with a no-nonsense industrial look (white ceramic finish, tintable) and field-tested resilience.

Slide 3: Core Capabilities & Benefits
	•	🔥 Fire Suppression: Rated Class A for flame spread (zero flame propagation) ￼. Does not contribute fuel or smoke in a fire – it effectively smothers flame spread on surfaces. In tests, it withstood direct 2700 °F torch fire for 20 minutes without burning through ￼.
	•	❄️ Thermal Insulation: Outstanding heat barrier – blocks radiant heat and slows conduction. Example: a metal door that felt like a “blast furnace” in the sun became cool to the touch after coating ￼. Lowers interior temps, cuts HVAC costs, and protects materials from thermal stress.
	•	🌊 Waterproof & Anti-Corrosion: Forms a seamless waterproof seal. Prevents water ingress and rust on steel (proven on bridge beams – significantly less corrosion over years ￼). Ideal for roofs and tanks – no leaks (even a cardboard box held water when painted) ￼.
	•	⚡ Electrical Insulation: Non-conductive ceramic layer insulates against electricity ￼. Helps safeguard structures from lightning and electrical surges by providing a dielectric barrier. Also blocks heat radiation and reduces thermal signatures – a “stealth” benefit in defense use ￼.
	•	💪 Flexibility & Durability: Elastic coating that expands/contracts with the substrate (no cracking or peeling) ￼. Withstands structural movement, vibrations, and extreme weather. Long-lasting performance – e.g., 10+ years with no recoat needed on a test facility ￼. Stays intact under UV, rain, and freeze/thaw cycles, far outliving conventional paint.

Slide 4: Technical Validation & Compliance
	•	Certified Fire Performance: Achieved Class A rating in ASTM E84 tests (Flame Spread 0; Smoke 0) ￼, far exceeding building code requirements (only ~7% of allowed smoke produced) ￼. In composite applications, meets UL 94 V-0, UL 94 5VA (self-extinguishing, no dripping) ￼. Compliant with ASTM D6413 fabric flammability and ISO 14116 flame spread standards ￼.
	•	Thermal & Electrical Tests: U.S. Army field-tested – coating effectively eliminated thermal IR detection of coated objects ￼. Also showed reduced radar signature (indicating potential anti-radar capability) ￼. Electrical insulation properties validated: zero electrical conduction through the coated layer ￼.
	•	Weathering & Endurance: Internal and external trials demonstrate exceptional longevity. The coating maintained integrity under intense UV and 110 °F heat for years ￼. Even after abrasive wear and washing, fire resistance remained intact (no performance loss in ISO 14116 tests after 5 washes) ￼.
	•	Environmental Safety: Water-based formula, low VOC – meets environmental regulations for indoor use and green building projects. No toxic smoke or off-gassing in fires ￼. Safe for use in occupied facilities (e.g. hospitals, schools) due to its benign chemistry and clean application process.

Slide 5: Key Use Cases
	•	🏗️ Bridges & Infrastructure: Coat steel bridges, overpasses, and highway structures to prevent rust and decay. Extends repaint cycles (bridges stayed rust-free much longer with Smart-Coat) ￼. Also provides a lightning-insulating shield for tall structures and protects concrete from spalling under heat.
	•	🏢 Commercial Buildings: Apply on building exteriors and roofs for a “cool roof” effect – cutting down AC usage in summer and strengthening fire resistance of the facade. Successful example: an office building saw comfortable indoor temps with no AC even at 110 °F after application ￼. Great for warehouses, data centers, and high-rises to meet safety codes and efficiency targets simultaneously.
	•	⚙️ Industrial & Energy Facilities: Use on oil & gas tanks, power plant equipment, and battery storage enclosures. Provides passive fire protection (buys time in case of a blaze) and thermal control. Being evaluated as a solution for EV and energy storage fires due to its ability to contain lithium battery flames ￼. Utilities can coat transformer boxes and substation structures to mitigate wildfire damage.
	•	🚒 Wildfire Defense (WUI homes): Spray on homes and critical structures in wildfire-prone areas. The ceramic layer makes wood and siding virtually fireproof, vastly improving a building’s chance to survive flying embers and brush fires ￼. Ideal for wildfire prevention programs and homeowner associations as a protective measure.
	•	🛡️ Defense & Military: Deploy on forward-operating base structures, fuel depots, and vehicles. Reduces heat signatures (camouflage from thermal drones) ￼ and adds fire/impact resistance to barracks or armored vehicles. Could be used to coat tents, uniforms or fabric shields when combined with graphene – tests in Korea showed a graphene+Smart-Coat fabric endured extreme fire with no damage ￼. Military engineering units can also use it on bridges or equipment for longevity and stealth.

Slide 6: The Praetorian Advantage – “Guarding What Matters”
	•	Same Trusted Shield, New Mission: Praetorian Smart-Coat is the rebranded Son-Shield – carrying forward a legacy of protection into new arenas. You get the exact same proven chemistry trusted on bridges and buildings worldwide, now under a brand that reflects its protective prowess.
	•	Holistic Protection: It’s not just paint, it’s a multi-functional armor for your assets – fire retardant, insulator, weatherproof barrier, and force multiplier for durability. One product addresses multiple failure points (fire, heat, moisture, corrosion), simplifying your asset protection strategy.
	•	Strategic Value: For C-level and government decision-makers, Praetorian Smart-Coat offers a high return on investment through extended asset life, reduced energy costs, and improved safety compliance.
