PRAETORIAN SMART-COAT

The World's Most Advanced Ceramic Fireproof and Thermal Barrier Coating

Formerly known as Son-Shield. Now battle-tested. Rebranded. Ready.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Praetorian Smart-Coat, evolved from the renowned Son-Shield system, is a multi-functional, ceramic-based protective coating engineered for fire defense, thermal regulation, corrosion resistance, and structural longevity. It is the only coating system on the market today that matches the documented performance of NASA-verified insulation systems while delivering ROI within 12-24 months in most industries. It is currently applied across military, infrastructure, industrial, agricultural, and high-risk residential sectors.
