ðŸš¨ This site still has unreadable text due to low contrast â€” NOT just white on white. I'm seeing light gray on gray, black on black, and other poor combinations.

You previously marked some of it as fixed, but it's NOT FIXED.

I need you to do a full forensic sweep AND fix the issue.

---

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE:
Identify and FIX all instances of **text that is unreadable or non-compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA contrast guidelines** across the entire site â€” including header, footer, body, overlays, modals, and mobile views.

---

ðŸ§  SCOPE:

1. Check **ALL text elements**:
   - `<p>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<h1>`â€“`<h6>`, `<button>`, nav links, labels, tooltips, modals, popouts, chat widgets, sliders

2. Analyze **final computed styles**:
   - Final `color` and `background-color` (inherited or declared)
   - Opacity, filters, pseudo-elements
   - Z-index and overlapping containers
   - Tailwind classes, CSS modules, global styles, inline styles, variables from theme.json
   - Responsive modifiers (`md:`, `dark:`, `hover:`, etc.)

3. Calculate **contrast ratio**:
   - Must be â‰¥ 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large/bold text
   - Must pass across **light mode**, **dark mode**, and **mobile viewports**

4. Identify the **root cause** of low contrast:
   - Conflicting class chains
   - !important overrides
   - Transparent or inherited backgrounds
   - Theme tokens producing non-contrasting values
   - Default Tailwind values causing color-on-color rendering

5. FIX THE PROBLEMS:
   - Change text colors or backgrounds to meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
   - Preserve visual hierarchy and branding, but make text readable
   - Prioritize semantic class updates or utility overrides, not just inline styling
   - Add background overlays where needed on top of images or gradients
   - Fix responsive and theme-based issues, not just desktop

âœ… FOR EACH FIX, DOCUMENT:
- File + line number
- Selector or component
- Original text color / background
- New applied style (class or inline)
- Updated contrast ratio (must be â‰¥ 4.5:1)
- Whether it affects mobile or desktop or both

---

ðŸ›‘ DO NOT skip anything.

- Fix unreadable headers, buttons, CTA labels, tooltips, forms, chat widgets
- Fix broken themes, overlapping z-indexes, or text hidden under parallax or blur layers
- Clean up conflicting or redundant CSS if necessary to make fixes stick

This is a **production-grade accessibility pass**. I want all visual contrast failures gone in one shot. Be thorough. Be final.
