5. Energy Conservation Services – Energy efficiency and conservation upgrades. Aimed to “help reduce energy costs and boost efficiency with customized solar solutions and system upgrades.” This could involve energy audits, LED lighting, HVAC optimizations, and other measures to cut usage.
	•	Product Offerings: One highlighted product is the “Family Energy Storage System,” an in-house designed lithium battery backup system. It’s described as “innovative and affordable… designed to help you take control of your energy usage.” This suggests a packaged home battery solution (likely APR’s own branded system, sometimes referred to as an APR Battery with BMS). The site content encourages customers to “embrace energy freedom today and build your future” with this storage system. Additionally, APR provides information on lead-acid battery care: they note that “lead-acid battery systems often face problems with corrosion and water levels” and require diligent maintenance – implicitly contrasting with their maintenance-free lithium offerings. (No other specific retail products (like solar panel brands) are listed on the site; the focus is on complete systems and solutions.)
	•	Staff & Leadership: The company’s founder and owner is Greg Tomsik, who is featured in the “About” story as the pioneer of the business (with the first off-grid project in 1999). Greg’s decades of expertise drive the company’s success. While the website doesn’t have a dedicated “Team” page, public sources (Facebook, Yelp) mention Greg, as well as team members Bill and Casey as points of contact. The “Meet the Owner” section on external sites notes Greg’s deep involvement in the North State’s renewable energy field (and customer reviews highlight his above-and-beyond service). In summary, Greg Tomsik (Founder/CEO) is the key figure, supported by a local team of solar installers and battery specialists.
	•	Website Content (by Page): The site is organized into several pages/sections, each with specific content:
	•	Home Page: Introduces Advance Power Redding’s mission and services. The homepage tagline (likely in a hero banner) states: “Advance Power Redding provides expert solar solutions, battery care, and energy-saving to help reduce costs and improve efficiency.” It emphasizes saving money and improving energy efficiency. The home page also highlights main service areas, possibly with brief teasers or links (e.g. Residential Solar Solutions, Lithium Battery Services, Energy Conservation, etc. are mentioned on the home page). We can infer the layout includes a quick overview of what they do (solar installations, battery systems, energy conservation) and a call-to-action to contact them.
	•	About Page: Provides background and credentials. It likely opens with a strong statement of expertise: “At Advance Power Redding, we empower you to take control of your energy needs.” followed by “With over 20 years of expertise, we are a leading licensed solar company specializing in building both grid-tied and off-grid solar systems.” This establishes their authority and range. The About page then has a section titled “Where It All Started.” Here, the company narrates its origin: “Our journey began in 1999 when our founder, Greg Tomsik, was tasked with constructing a custom, off-grid home.” This story likely explains how that successful off-grid project led to the founding of Advance Power. The page may mention milestones or philosophies (e.g., commitment to energy independence and innovation). It reinforces that APR has decades of local experience and even states examples of achievements (e.g., powering a Shasta Lake marina) and their commitment to not quitting until the job is perfect. The about page conveys trust, experience, and local roots.
	•	Services Pages: Each service listed above has its own page with details:
	•	Residential Solar Solutions: Describes how APR serves homeowners. It mentions 20+ years experience in residential PV installations in Redding and assures quality and affordability (*“high-quality, reliable solutions” within your budget). It likely touches on benefits like reducing bills, net metering, and possibly financing or rebates (though not explicitly in the snippet).

	•	Fax: (530) 226-0704
	•	Email: info@apredding.net
	•	Address: 843 North Market Street, Redding, CA 96003
	•	Hours: Monday – Friday, 9am – 5pm (closed Sat-Sun).
The page likely includes a contact form (labeled “Send Us a Message”) where users can fill in their name, email, phone, and inquiry. A note indicates required fields (e.g., “Fields marked [] are required”*). There may also be a map embedded or a link for directions. The tone assures that the APR team is ready to provide support and answers quickly.
	•	Privacy Policy & Terms: The site has a combined Privacy Policy/Terms of Use page. It starts with a greeting (“Welcome to Advance Power Redding. Our website address is: apredding.net.”) and provides contact information for any policy inquiries (reiterating the phone and email). It then outlines how user data is handled, likely covering cookies and forms (standard privacy statement) and the terms for using the site (no unauthorized use of content, etc.). This page confirms that personal data submitted (like through the contact form) is kept secure and only used to respond to inquiries, etc., as per common practice. It’s mostly boilerplate but it is part of the publicly available content.
	•	Footer: The footer appears on all pages with key info and navigation. It shows Contact Information (phone, fax, address, email) and a navigation menu labeled “Navigate:”. The footer nav links mirror the main menu: Home, Services, About, FAQ’s, Contact Us. There is also a “Follow Us On Social” prompt – with icons/links (the primary one is Facebook, linking to facebook.com/apredding.net). This indicates APR’s social media presence (Facebook page with updates and customer interactions). The footer ensures that a visitor can access any main section or contact info from any page easily.
	•	Images & Media Assets: The Advance Power Redding site uses imagery to reinforce its content. Key media elements include:
	•	Company Logo: The APR logo is displayed (likely in the website header and footer). Alt text would be the company name (e.g., “Advance Power Redding logo”). The logo is presumably a graphic with the company name and maybe a solar-themed icon. (The exact file URL isn’t given, but it’s hosted on apredding.net; the Facebook profile photo suggests this logo.)
	•	Hero Banner Image: The home page likely has a hero image – for example, a photo of solar panels installed on a roof under the California sun, or a happy family with solar panels – conveying the solar energy theme.
	•	Service Images: Each service page probably features a representative image:
	•	Residential Solar might show a house with solar panels,
	•	Commercial Solar could show a commercial building or solar farm,
	•	Hybrid Systems might depict solar panels plus a battery unit,
	•	Lithium Battery Services likely shows a close-up of a lithium battery bank or an inverter/battery system setup,
	•	Energy Conservation might show an energy-efficient home or someone performing an energy audit.
All images would have descriptive alt text (e.g., “Residential solar panels on rooftop,” “Commercial solar array on business,” “Home battery backup unit” etc.), aligning with accessibility guidelines.
	•	Team/Facility Photos: It’s possible the site includes a photo of the Advance Power Redding team or the storefront at 843 N Market Street, to personalize the business. If present, alt text would describe it (e.g., “Advance Power Redding office front” or “Our solar installation team in Redding”).
	•	Misc. Graphics: Icons or graphics might be used for highlighting solar benefits (like a sun icon, battery icon, or dollar savings icon). For example, an icon for “battery care” or “energy savings” might appear alongside text. These would also include appropriate alt tags.
	•	Media URLs: The actual image files likely reside under the website’s directory (e.g., https://www.apredding.net/wp-content/uploads/... if WordPress or in a static /assets folder if React app). We don’t have the exact URLs, but notable media identified on the site include the logo and images for each service category. All are publicly visible on the site. (There were also 3 photos on the Yelp listing for APR – possibly the same images of installations or the crew – though those are external uploads.)
	•	Navigation & Site Structure: The site’s main navigation menu (typically at the top of each page) has the following structure:
	•	Home – links to the homepage (/).
	•	Services – a dropdown menu containing the subpages: Residential Solar Solutions, Commercial Solar Solutions, Hybrid Solar Systems, Lithium Battery Services, Energy Conservation Services. (On the site, “Services” is the category; clicking it might either open a general Services page or simply reveal the dropdown – the snippet suggests it’s just a menu label.) These five pages are the primary service offerings of APR.
	•	About – links to /about/ (company background page).
	•	FAQ’s – links to /faq/ (the frequently asked questions page).
	•	Contact Us – links to /contact/ (contact page with form and details).
	•	(The main menu thus consists of Home and four other main items, one of which (Services) contains multiple sub-links. This matches the user’s note of “4 subpages off the home page instead of 6,” implying the Praetorian site had 6 main sections whereas APR’s has 4 main sections + home.)
	•	Footer links: The footer duplicates these navigation links for convenience.
	•	Social Media: A Facebook icon in the footer (and possibly Instagram or LinkedIn if they had them, though only Facebook is explicitly mentioned) allows visitors to connect with APR on social platforms.
	•	Site Map/Structure: In summary, all public pages on apredding.net are: Home, About, Contact, FAQ, the five Services pages, plus the Privacy/Terms page. Additionally, there are a couple of blog-style pages (e.g., the Family Energy Storage System page and Lead Acid Battery Care article) that are not in the main menu but are accessible via links or search. The overall structure is straightforward, allowing users to learn about the company, explore services, get common questions answered, and reach out for more information.

Step-by-Step Master Prompt for Replit Rebuild

Goal: Transform the existing cloned React.js app (originally built for “Praetorian”) into a white-labeled Advance Power Redding web application. This includes removing all Praetorian branding and data, applying Advance Power Redding’s branding (logo, color scheme, company name), configuring a new PostgreSQL database within Replit, and populating it with real content extracted from apredding.net. The final site should mirror Advance Power Redding’s current structure and pages (Home + 4 main pages, with Services as a section containing 5 subpages), effectively deploying a brand-new instance of the app for Advance Power Redding.

Instructions (to Replit’s AI development tool):
	1.	Remove Praetorian Branding and References:
	•	Open the project files and find & replace any occurrence of the word “Praetorian” (or Praetorian-specific terms) with “Advance Power Redding”. This includes:
	•	Text content (headings, titles, descriptions) in React components, HTML files, or JSON data.
	•	Company name in metadata (e.g., <title> tag, meta descriptions) – update to “Advance Power Redding” and related slogans.
	•	Filenames or variables that reference “praetorian” (e.g., praetorianLogo.png, CSS classes, etc.) – rename these to reflect APR (e.g., aprLogo.png or companyLogo.png).
	•	Delete or replace Praetorian logo/images: Remove the Praetorian logo and any branding images from the project. In their place, add Advance Power Redding’s logo. (If you have the APR logo file, add it to the project assets and import it. If not, use a placeholder with the text “APR” or a generic solar image with “Advance Power Redding” alt text.)
	•	Update color scheme: If the Praetorian app had a specific color theme (say, Praetorian’s brand colors), adjust the CSS/ styling to use Advance Power Redding’s color palette. For example, use colors that convey renewable energy – perhaps solar orange or green accents – aligning with APR’s branding. Ensure consistency across components (buttons, headers, footers).
	•	Remove any Praetorian-specific slogans or content. For instance, if a header said “Welcome to Praetorian” or included Praetorian’s mission, replace it with Advance Power Redding’s tagline or mission (from the site content). The new tagline can be: “Northern California’s leader in solar solutions and battery storage – providing energy independence to our community.” (This encapsulates APR’s positioning based on the extracted data.)
	•	Go through all pages/components (Home, About, etc.) and scrub out any remaining Praetorian names, ensuring the app’s text now only references Advance Power Redding or uses generic placeholders to be filled with APR content.
	2.	White-Label with Advance Power Redding Branding:
	•	Logo & Images: Import and use Advance Power Redding’s logo in the navigation bar and footer. Set the alt attribute to “Advance Power Redding logo”. Similarly, update the favicon if applicable. Replace hero images or banners with images relevant to APR (solar panels, batteries, etc.). For example, set the homepage hero background to a solar installation image (with alt text “Solar panels on a home in sunlight”). Ensure these images are either included in the project or accessible via URL.
	•	Update Text Content: Where the Praetorian app had placeholder text or content, insert Advance Power Redding’s real content:
	•	Home Page: Replace the main headline/subheadline with APR’s actual pitch. For example, use: “Advance Power Redding – Expert Solar Solutions & Battery Systems” as a headline, and a sub-text like “Providing solar installations, lithium battery storage, and energy-saving services to reduce your costs and ensure energy independence.” (This is derived from the site’s description.) Ensure a call-to-action button like “Contact Us for a Free Quote” links to the Contact page.
	•	About Page: Update the about section to reflect APR’s story. Include a paragraph about their 20+ years in business and founding in 1999 by Greg Tomsik. E.g.: “Advance Power Redding was founded in 1999 by Greg Tomsik with a mission to empower people through energy independence. With over 20 years of experience, we have grown into the North State’s leading solar provider – from our first off-grid home project to thousands of installations today. We pride ourselves on quality work and don’t quit until your system works perfectly.” This text can be placed in the About component or fetched from the database (to be set up in step 3).
	•	Services Pages: Create or edit components/pages for each of the five service offerings (Residential Solar, Commercial Solar, Hybrid Systems, Lithium Battery, Energy Conservation). For each page, set the title and content to APR’s real service info. (Details on content to use are in step 4 below when populating the database. In summary: residential focuses on serving families with PV systems, commercial on custom business solutions, hybrid on solar+storage combos, lithium services on battery installation and advantages, and conservation on efficiency upgrades.)
	•	FAQ Page: Ensure there is a component to list FAQs. Use Advance Power Redding’s common questions and answers (we will populate these from the database in step 4). Remove any Praetorian-specific FAQ entries and replace with solar/battery Q&A relevant to APR (e.g., types of systems offered, maintenance of batteries, savings, etc. as gathered from the site).
	•	Contact Page: Update contact information to APR’s: insert the phone number, fax, address, email, and hours from the data we gathered. For instance, display: Phone: 530-226-0701, Fax: 530-226-0704, Email: info@apredding.net, Address: 843 N. Market St, Redding CA 96003, Hours: Mon–Fri 9am-5pm. Remove any Praetorian contact info. Adjust the contact form to send submissions to info@apredding.net or simply display a success message (depending on how the form is handled in the app). Make sure the form fields (Name, Email, Phone, Message) are labeled and functioning.
	•	Navigation/Menu: Change the navigation menu items to: Home, Services, About, FAQ’s, Contact Us (instead of whatever Praetorian had). Implement a dropdown under “Services” listing the five service pages. Ensure the menu styling matches APR’s branding (for example, highlight the active page, etc.). Also update the footer to have the correct links and label (“Follow Us On Social” with a Facebook icon linking to APR’s Facebook page).
	•	Page Titles & Meta: Update each page’s <title> and meta description to reflect APR content. For example, the About page <title> could be “About – Advance Power Redding | Solar in Redding, CA”, and the meta description can be a short summary of APR (e.g., “Advance Power Redding is a leading solar energy company in Northern California with 20+ years of experience in solar installations and battery systems.”). Use the extracted content to craft these summaries, incorporating keywords like solar, battery storage, Redding. This will ensure the deployed site is SEO-friendly and accurately described.
	3.	Reconfigure Database for Replit (Postgres Setup):
	•	Initialize a new PostgreSQL database in the Replit environment. (If the Replit workspace has a built-in DB option, use that; otherwise, install and run Postgres or use an embedded SQLite for simplicity – but Postgres is preferred as specified.) Ensure the database is running and accessible to the app (you may need to adjust docker-compose or .replit config to start the Postgres service).
	•	Update database connection settings in the app’s backend code. If the Praetorian app used an external database or a different DB (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL), remove those configs. Instead, add configuration for connecting to the local Postgres. For example, set environment variables for PGHOST, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, PGDATABASE (or update a config file) to connect to the new Postgres instance. Use defaults for a local dev DB or Replit’s provided connection string.
	•	Define the schema: Based on Advance Power Redding’s content needs, create tables in Postgres to store the site content. You can use a migration tool or raw SQL. Key tables/fields:
	•	Pages – for static pages like About, Contact, Home. Fields: id (int), slug (text, e.g. “home”, “about”), title (text), body (text or JSON for structured content). This will hold things like the about page text, home page blurb, etc.
	•	Services – for each service page. Fields: id, slug (e.g. “residential-solar”, “commercial-solar”), title, description (text for the main content of that service page). We will insert 5 records here.
	•	FAQs – Fields: id, question, answer (text for both). We will insert multiple FAQ entries.
	•	ContactInfo (optional) – Fields: id, phone, fax, email, address, hours. (Alternatively, we can store this in the Pages table under a “contact” page, but having a separate table can be convenient for quickly pulling contact details for footer or other components.)
	•	(If the original app had a similar structure, adapt it; e.g., some React apps might not use a DB for content at all and instead have hardcoded content. In that case, we’ll simply be “seeding” these values into the code directly. But since the prompt suggests using Postgres, we treat content as data-driven.)
	•	Run migrations to create these tables in the Postgres database. Verify the tables are created (you can use a management tool or logs).
	•	Remove any legacy Praetorian data tables if present, unless they can be repurposed (for example, if Praetorian had a “posts” or “articles” table, you might repurpose it for news or leave it empty if APR site doesn’t use it).
	•	The end result should be an empty schema ready to be filled with Advance Power Redding’s content.
	4.	Populate the Database with Advance Power Redding Content:
	•	Now insert the extracted content into the new tables. This effectively seeds the site with the real data. Perform these inserts via a seeding script or migration:
	•	Pages table: Add entries for at least Home, About, Contact (and possibly Privacy Policy if needed):
	•	Home: slug: "home", title: "Advance Power Redding", body: a brief welcome message. For example, “Advance Power Redding provides expert solar solutions, battery care, and energy-saving services to help you reduce costs and improve efficiency.” plus a sentence like “We are Northern California’s leader in renewable energy with over 20 years of experience.” This combination gives a strong intro. (This content can be used in a hero section or welcome panel on the homepage.)
	•	About: slug: "about", title: "About Us", body: the full about text. This should include the founder story and mission. For example, incorporate text from the site: “At Advance Power Redding, we empower you to take control of your energy needs. With over 20 years of expertise, we’re a leading licensed solar company building both grid-tied and off-grid systems.” Then the history: “Our journey began in 1999 when our founder, Greg Tomsik, built a custom off-grid home – sparking a passion that led to the creation of Advance Power Redding.” Continue with their present-day status: “Today, after thousands of successful solar and battery installations – from small residential setups to powering a marina – we remain committed to delivering energy independence to our community. We don’t quit until everything works perfectly for you.” This body text can be formatted into paragraphs or sections as needed in the front-end.
	•	Contact: slug: "contact", title: "Contact Us", body: you might store the basic contact text here or just rely on the ContactInfo table. However, to keep things simple, this can contain a friendly prompt like “We’re here to help! Have questions or need assistance? Our team is ready to provide the support you need.” followed by the primary contact details (phone, email, address, hours). (Alternatively, skip body and use the ContactInfo table exclusively in the front-end.)
	•	Privacy: (optional) slug: "privacy", title: "Privacy Policy & Terms", body: the boilerplate text. Since this is lengthy, you can copy the template from the current site if available or leave a placeholder that will be filled in later. Ensure it includes the contact info for reference.
	•	Services table: Insert one row for each of the five services:
	1.	Residential Solar Solutions:

	5.	Integrate Database Content into the React App:
	•	Now modify the React front-end (and any back-end API if present) to fetch and display this data:
	•	If the app has an API layer (Node/Express or similar), create endpoints like /api/pages/:slug, /api/services, /api/faqs etc., to retrieve content from Postgres. Otherwise, use a static import or a context that holds the data (depending on how the original app handled content).
	•	Home page: Instead of hardcoding text, fetch the home page content. For example, call an API or query the Pages table for slug “home” and display its body text on the home component. Also display highlights of services if desired (maybe fetch 2-3 service titles from the Services table to feature on home with links).
	•	About page: Fetch the “about” page content from DB and render the rich text/paragraphs describing APR. Include sub-sections or headings as needed (e.g., a heading for “Where It All Started” could be coded in the component if the text in DB includes that phrase).
	•	Services pages: Implement each service page to fetch by slug (e.g., “residential-solar”) from the Services table and display its title and description. Ensure the route /services/residential-solar (or similar) loads the Residential Solar component and after fetching data sets the content. Do this for all five services. If the original app had dynamic routing set up for sections, reuse that, otherwise define static routes for each or a generic route that uses the slug.
	•	FAQ page: Fetch all entries from the FAQs table and render them in an accordion or list format. Each Q can be a question heading that reveals the answer on click. Use the actual questions and answers from the DB, which we populated with APR’s FAQs. Remove any placeholder FAQ data from Praetorian.
	•	Contact page: Pull from ContactInfo table for the contact details. Display the phone, fax, address, email, and hours from the DB rather than any old constants. Ensure that clicking on the email opens mailto:info@apredding.net, and clicking on the address could link to Google Maps if desired. The contact form can remain mostly front-end – on submit, you might simply log the message or send it to a dummy endpoint since full email integration is outside scope (unless the original app had it). The key is that the displayed info is correct and coming from our data source.
	•	Footer: Likewise, use the ContactInfo and navigation data. The footer can fetch phone/email from ContactInfo so it’s consistent. The nav links (Home, Services, About, FAQ, Contact) are static, but ensure they point to the right routes. Also add an anchor for the Facebook link (“Follow Us on Social” icon) – use href="https://facebook.com/apredding.net" and target="_blank". (No DB needed for that since it’s a constant.)
	•	Verify that all components are now using live data from the database. This ensures that if content needs updating, it can be changed via the database entries rather than editing the code.
	6.	Adjust Navigation and Routes (4 main pages instead of 6):
	•	The original Praetorian app had 6 main pages in the menu. Now we need exactly 4 main pages (excluding Home). Those are: Services, About, FAQ’s, Contact Us. Update the routing and menu to reflect this:
	•	Remove any extra menu items that Praetorian had (for example, if there was an “Blog” or “Team” page in the old app that APR doesn’t use, eliminate it).
	•	Add the Services menu item if it wasn’t there. Implement it as a dropdown (with sub-items for each service page). In mobile view, ensure the services sub-menu is accessible. If the original app already grouped items, adjust the grouping to have exactly those 5 in Services.
	•	Check the route paths: For instance, if the original had /services as a page listing all services, you can repurpose it or disable it. It might be acceptable to have /services route show either a summary of all services or redirect to the first service. Since APR’s site doesn’t have a standalone “Services” overview page (it just serves as a menu header), you might route /services to, say, /services/residential-solar or create a brief landing page that lists links to each service.
	•	Ensure that clicking About goes to the about page, FAQ’s to the FAQ page, Contact Us to contact page. These should match the updated routes and fetch data accordingly.
	•	Double-check the Services dropdown: it should list “Residential Solar Solutions”, “Commercial Solar Solutions”, “Hybrid Solar Systems”, “Lithium Battery Services”, “Energy Conservation Services”. Each should link to the corresponding route (e.g., /services/lithium-battery). Update the <Nav> or menu component in React accordingly. Remove any leftover Praetorian service pages that don’t apply.
	•	Remove route definitions for any pages not in use. For example, if Praetorian had an “About Us” and “Our Team” as separate pages but APR only has one About, consolidate and remove the extra. The final set of routes should cover: Home (/), About (/about), Contact (/contact), FAQ (/faq), and each Service (/services/[slug] for 5 slugs). The Privacy Policy could be /privacy (you can link it in footer discreetly).
	•	Check that the 404 Not Found page (if any) is updated to APR styling and that any reference to Praetorian there is gone. Optionally, you can create a friendly 404 that directs users to the main pages.
	7.	Testing & Launch Preparation:
	•	Run the application in Replit’s development mode. Open each page in the browser to verify content:
	•	Home: Should show APR’s tagline and maybe summaries or links to services. Ensure images load and text is correct.
	•	About: Verify the about text is present (founder story, experience, etc.) and formatted nicely (paragraphs, maybe bolded key names or years).
	•	Each Service page: Confirm the correct title and description is displayed for Residential, Commercial, Hybrid, Lithium, Conservation. The text should match what we inserted (check for typos or missing data). If any page shows dummy text or Praetorian content, fix it by binding the correct data.
	•	FAQ: Ensure all Q&As appear. Test the expand/collapse if implemented. Make sure formatting is clear (e.g., questions in bold, answers in normal text). Check that special terms like “grid-tied” or “LiFePO4” are understandable (you might add a tooltip or parentheses explaining LiFePO4 = lithium iron phosphate, for user clarity, if desired).
	•	Contact: Verify phone number, email, address are exactly as provided. Click on the email and address to see if they function (email opens an email client; address could open Google Maps if linked). Submit a test message in the form to ensure it doesn’t error out (you can have it simply console.log on submit for now). Check that business hours are listed correctly (Mon-Fri 9am-5pm).
	•	Footer: Confirm the footer shows the contact info and menu links. Also click the Facebook icon to ensure it goes to APR’s Facebook page (it should open facebook.com/apredding.net). The footer text “Follow Us On Social” should no longer say anything like Praetorian.
	•	Cross-check content vs. source: Compare the site’s content with what we extracted to ensure nothing was omitted:
	•	Ensure mention of 20 years experience is present (it’s a key selling point).
	•	Ensure Greg Tomsik’s founding story is mentioned (adds authenticity).
	•	Ensure no maintenance lithium is highlighted in relevant pages/FAQ (differentiator).
	•	Ensure contact info is 100% accurate (especially email spelling and phone digits).
	•	If any piece is missing (like perhaps the Privacy Policy text), add it now from a template or leave a placeholder link that you’ll fill in later.
	•	Responsive design: Resize the Replit preview or open dev tools to simulate mobile. Check that the navigation collapses properly (the Services dropdown should be accessible on mobile via a menu). Ensure text and images scale well. For example, long service descriptions might need extra CSS for mobile readability (you can add some padding or smaller font on small screens).
	•	Performance: Since we added a database, ensure that data fetching is efficient. Perhaps cache the content on the front-end or load it once (these are small text entries, so performance is fine). The site is mostly informational, so just verify there’s no obvious lag when switching pages.
	•	Once everything looks correct, commit/save the changes in Replit. The app is now effectively Advance Power Redding’s website, running with real content and a Postgres database backing it.
	8.	Finalize Deployment:
	•	Remove any development/test artifacts (e.g., console logs, test routes).
	•	In Replit, ensure the web server is set to serve the React app (if it’s a CRA or Next.js or similar, make sure it’s building/serving correctly). Adjust the Replit run command if needed (for example, if using npm start for CRA, that should be fine).
	•	Once running, the site should be accessible via the Replit URL. Go through each page one more time on the live URL to double-check.
	•	Provide the client (or stakeholders) with the link to the Replit deployment for Advance Power Redding. Instruct them on how the content is now managed via the database (for example, they could edit FAQ answers by running a simple SQL update in the Replit console or by us providing an admin interface in the future).
	•	The result is a brand-new white-labeled deployment: the app’s UI and content now reflect Advance Power of Redding branding and real data, with no trace of Praetorian. All pages (Home, Services (5 subpages), About, FAQ, Contact) are live and populated with accurate information from apredding.net. The database is running internally on Replit (Postgres) storing all site content, which ensures the data can be persisted and easily updated as needed.
