 ⚠️ PHASE 0.9 — POST-OPTIMIZATION DIAGNOSTIC + HARDLINE DEBUGGING

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Despite significant frontend optimization, the site still experiences unacceptable load time. Begin **direct runtime profiling**, live load diagnostics, and backend/fetch monitoring to uncover hidden lag sources. DO NOT make further optimizations until root causes are logged and reported.

## ✅ EXECUTE THIS DIAGNOSTIC BUNDLE:

### 1. 🕵️ RUNTIME PROFILING
- Capture and print the exact timestamps of:
  - Initial load trigger
  - DOMContentLoaded
  - First Paint
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - First Input Delay (FID)
- Use `performance.mark()` and `performance.measure()` if needed

### 2. 🌐 NETWORK SNAPSHOT
- List ALL outgoing network requests on page load
- For each:
  - Log the full URL
  - Response time
  - Status code
  - Payload size
- Flag any fetch/XHR request that takes more than 500ms

### 3. 🔁 LOOP OR MEMORY ISSUES
- Confirm there are no infinite loops in React/Vue useEffect/render
- Run memory profiling on app boot
- Detect if there are repeated state re-renders or hydration failures

### 4. 🧱 BACKEND/API BLOCKERS
- Identify any API or DB call triggered at load
- Log:
  - Endpoint
  - Latency
  - Status
  - Payload
- Flag if any are failing or retrying

### 5. 🔌 HOSTING CONFIG VALIDATION
- Confirm `.replit` is set to production mode
- Ensure NO dev flags or debug tools are loading in production
- Log what build mode is being executed
- Log build time (not app run time)

### 6. 🧾 RETURN OUTPUT IN THIS FORMAT

### ⚙️ PHASE 0.9 RESULTS

- 🧭 Page Load Events:
  - TTFB: XXms
  - DOMContentLoaded: XXms
  - LCP: XXms
  - FID: XXms

- 🌐 Network Requests (on load):
  - [URL] - 1023ms - 200 - 1.2MB
  - [URL] - 721ms - 500 - FAILED

- 🔁 React/Vue Loop Check: [✓ / ✗]
- 💾 Memory Usage at Boot: XX MB
- 🔌 Build Mode: [Dev / Prod]
- 🔨 Build Time: XXs

- 🔍 Key Suspects:
  - [Slow API call]
  - [Massive dependency]
  - [Async function not resolving]

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

DO NOT clean, remove, or optimize anything yet.
Just find the fire. Wait for Bossman’s go-ahead to pull the trigger.
