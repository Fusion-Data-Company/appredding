# Solar Energy Platform - Project Documentation

## Overview
A cutting-edge solar energy platform that transforms renewable energy adoption through innovative digital experiences and advanced interactive technologies.

Core Technologies:
- React.js with TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Framer Motion for interactive animations
- Express.js backend
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Advanced solar analysis tools with immersive UI components

## Current State
Phase 1 Mandate: Frontend Structural & Interaction Verification
- Conducting comprehensive codebase analysis and runtime check
- NO design, font, color, layout, or visual asset changes allowed
- Focus on function-only audit and performance analysis

## Critical Performance Issues Identified (PHASE 1 AUDIT COMPLETE)
- **CATASTROPHIC LCP**: 8,708ms - 23,324ms (Target: <2,500ms)
- **Zod Validation Errors**: Performance API receiving null data causing continuous errors
- **Network Fetch Failures**: Vite WebSocket connection failures every 30-60 seconds
- **Performance Monitoring Overhead**: Multiple PerformanceObserver instances causing system slowdown
- **Bundle Optimization Issues**: Large synchronous JavaScript loads
- **Image Loading Problems**: Lazy loading and optimization not fully active

**Status**: Phase 1 audit completed - Critical issues documented in PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md

## Recent Changes
- Added advanced image optimization system with WebP/AVIF support
- Implemented FastHeroImage component and comprehensive image preloading
- Added cache worker and service worker for improved image delivery
- Fixed performance monitoring debouncing to prevent system freezing
- Enhanced lazy loading implementation for all homepage sections
- Fixed API endpoints to prevent 400 errors and crashes

## User Preferences
- Strict no-design-change policy during audit phase
- Focus on performance and functional issues only
- Comprehensive analysis before making any modifications
- Document all findings before suggesting solutions

## Project Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite build system
- Backend: Express.js with middleware for compression and error handling
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Performance: Advanced monitoring with error reporting
- Optimization: Image optimization, lazy loading, service workers
