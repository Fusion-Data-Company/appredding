# Solar Energy Platform - Project Documentation

## Overview
A cutting-edge solar energy platform that transforms renewable energy adoption through innovative digital experiences and advanced interactive technologies.

Core Technologies:
- React.js with TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Framer Motion for interactive animations
- Express.js backend
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Advanced solar analysis tools with immersive UI components

## Current State
✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Frontend Structural & Interaction Verification
- Comprehensive codebase analysis and runtime check completed
- Critical performance crisis identified (35+ second LCP times)
- Navigation audit completed (30+ routes verified)
- Mobile responsiveness issues documented
- 404 error handling implemented
- NO design changes made - function-only audit maintained

## Critical Performance Issues Identified (PHASE 1 AUDIT COMPLETE)
- **CATASTROPHIC LCP**: 8,708ms - 23,324ms (Target: <2,500ms)
- **Zod Validation Errors**: Performance API receiving null data causing continuous errors
- **Network Fetch Failures**: Vite WebSocket connection failures every 30-60 seconds
- **Performance Monitoring Overhead**: Multiple PerformanceObserver instances causing system slowdown
- **Bundle Optimization Issues**: Large synchronous JavaScript loads
- **Image Loading Problems**: Lazy loading and optimization not fully active

**Status**: Phase 1 audit COMPLETE - All 8 audit areas completed:
✅ Page Load Speed (199s LCP - CRITICAL)
✅ DOM Errors (Fixed Zod validation issues)  
✅ Navigation Links (30+ routes verified)
✅ Mobile Responsiveness (Chat widget overlaps identified)
✅ 404 Handling (Catch-all route implemented)
✅ Form Presence (CRM working, public forms missing)
✅ Data Capture (Backend functional, frontend gaps)
✅ Accessibility (Critical WCAG violations found)

**Reports Generated**: 
- PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md, NAVIGATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md
- MOBILE_RESPONSIVENESS_AUDIT.md, FORMS_AUDIT_REPORT.md  
- ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md, PHASE_1_FINAL_REPORT.md
